Linux Device driver for Microchip ZL3073X
==============================================================================

This repo contains the sources for the ZL3073X. It is split in 2 different
directories, one for the mfd driver and one for the ptp driver.
The mfd driver is used to convert from regmap reads/write to specific i2c or spi
transactions.
The ptp driver is used to expose the phc clock which can be used with any
userspace application to control it.

Depending on your board designed it is required to have the microchip-dpll-i2c
or the microchip-dpll-spi driver.

Note that the zl3073x naming used in the code covers all Azurite-based family of products including ZL80132B.
